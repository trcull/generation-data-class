And when they apply to vote by mail, it makes it significantly more likely they will cast a ballot.

You can write the postcards from your own home! Just pick up your packet of 30 postcards and addresses, customize the postcards at home, and return the postcards by the deadline date.

The cost of each packet is $25. Using check or PayPal expedites your pick up.

## Additional Precautions
Please protect your health and the health of the community.

If you have underlying health conditions or other risk factors, please ask a friend to pick up your packets for you. We may be able to drop them off at your home; ask if you need that.

Thank you for helping us turn out Florida's Blue voters. We'll both take back the White House and blunt Republican gerrymandering!

The OoP is excited to phone bank for Michele Knoll and Joe Biden on Sunday, August 16th! This event represents a fantastic opportunity to connect with swing voters to help Michele flip HD44 while also getting out the vote for Joe Biden.

Here’s how it will work:

3:00 Meet briefly in Zoom to check in with your friends, hear from the candidate, and go over campaign talking points. We will make sure you have all of the information you need to call with confidence.

3:15 Start phonebanking! You can either mute yourself in Zoom or leave Zoom and rejoin when you’re done. Training and practice will be provided for anyone new to phone banking. We will be on hand to support you while you dial and answer any questions that come up.

4:45 Return to Zoom to share stories, hang out, and maybe have a celebratory drink.

5:00 You’re finished, having done your part to ensure victory in November! How awesome are you?!?

Here’s what you’ll need to do in advance: Make sure you have an Action ID account. You’ll need this to log in to the virtual phone bank. If you have canvassed using the MiniVAN app or phone banked before, you probably already have one. If not, here are the instructions. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eHyDbbhUH93oEnplFbNHZbhO1noROsE_/view

Need help? Contact Jen Sybrandt at jsybrandt@back2blue2020.com.

You'll personalize and address postcards to likely Democrats, telling them how to request a Vote By Mail ballot. Our postcards increase their probability of applying to vote by mail. And when they apply to vote by mail, it makes it significantly more likely they will cast a ballot.

You can write the postcards from your own home! Just pick up your packet of 20 postcards and addresses, customize the postcards at home, and return the postcards between Aug 15-22.

The cost of each packet of 20 postcards and all the supplies you need is $17. Using paypal or venmo make things easy.

## Additional Precautions
Please protect your health and the health of the community.

If you have underlying health conditions or other risk factors, please ask a friend to pick up your packets for you. We may be able to drop them off at your home; ask if you need that.

Thank you for helping us turn out Florida's Blue voters. We'll both take back the White House and blunt Republican gerrymandering!

Virtual phone banks have become an essential part of turning Arizona blue, and every phonbanker plays a pivotal role.  This will be our biggest weekend yet as a campaign, and we need your help.

Whether you’re new to campaigns or an expert, you have a place with our people-powered campaign. The good news is, phone banking is easy to learn and can be done from the comfort of your own home!

You will need a phone (and a laptop or tablet, if you have one). Prior to your phonebanking shift, your local organizer will reach out for a comprehensive training, where we’ll get you set up, walk you through our phonebanking process and script, and answer any questions you might have.

Volunteers will help Mission for Arizona unite Democrats across Arizona and build upon our historic success in 2018 to elect Mark Kelly and Democrats up and down the ticket.

RSVP today and invite a friend to join us!"

You'll personalize and address postcards to likely Democrats, telling them how to request a Vote By Mail ballot. Our postcards increase their probability of applying to vote by mail. And when they apply to vote by mail, it makes it significantly more likely they will cast a ballot.

You can write the postcards from your own home! Just pick up your packet of 30 postcards and addresses, customize the postcards at home, and return the postcards by the deadline date.

Your packet includes 30 postcards, 60 postcard stamps, a mailing list and instructions.  A Florida Democrats finance form is also provided and can be filled in a pick up or returned via email photo.  The cost of each packet is $25. Using check or exact change expedites your pick up.

The Boston Back Bay pick-up location will be emailed to you after sign-up.

## Additional Precautions
Please protect your health and the health of the community.

If you have underlying health conditions or other risk factors, please ask a friend to pick up your packets for you. We may be able to drop them off at your home; ask if you need that.

Thank you for helping us turn out Florida's Blue voters. We'll both take back the White House and blunt Republican gerrymandering!

Join Michigan Democrats in Downriver for our weekly policy chat, where we **dive into climate policy** and discuss our Democratic plans for the White house.

We need to transform our world into a greener, more sustainable future to protect the coming generations and ensure they live with the same diversity of nature that we do.  **Joe Biden and Gary Peters have plans on how to move America to the greener future we need, to protect lives here in the USA and all life around the world.**

Meet our Downriver Organizing Team and talk about the Detroit River, and how we can be the best stewards to our natural resources here at home. Have some lunch with us, and build our community here as downriver democrats. We will discuss the policy, and what local action you can take to make sure we get the representation we deserve.

If you’re a regular phone banker, you’ll get lots of information to share with voters on the phone, and if you are new to phone banking or considering how else you can make a difference this historic election, we’ll get you connected to the best way you can ensure you **don’t wake up on November 4th thinking “I wish I had done something”.**

The Internet was supposed to change our democracy, make it easier to share information and to communicate with one another. For better or worse, it has changed the very fabric of our society.

Using social media can be difficult, and it can be even more difficult to know how use social media in a way that mobilizes people to take action for our cause. But social media is a powerful tool to reach many people in our social network at once.

Before getting involved in this campaign, I have worked with a variety of community organizations that have successfully used Facebook groups and Twitter to mobilize people in their communities. This upcoming Wednesday, I want to share those tips and tricks with you. When used correctly, social media can be an incredibly powerful tool that will help us flip Arizona blue in November.

It can be daunting, but we're in this together."

Virtual Letter Writing Party,"Let's get together (virtually) again to write some more letters to potential voters in critical states!

How to get your letters to write? There are 2 possible ways:

If you live in the area, I have printed packets of 20 letters + envelopes. You let me know how many you want and when you're swinging by and I can leave packets in my mailbox (street level) with your name on them (NB: this is not recommended by SwingLeft, but I appreciate that some may not have a printer or envelopes)

OR : sign up at Vote Forward (votefwd.org) and make an account (I strongly suggest doing this a few days in advance so that you can get approved in time!). Then, download twenty letters; and we’ll show you how to write them at our virtual party! I will go over instructions and tips on filling out the letters at the start of the party (pro-tip: grab a couple of non-black pens!)

Please join with video and we write some letters! Have some nice food and drinks to go with your 20 letters--you deserve it!

After that, if you want, please drop the letters (in their envelopes) back at my mailbox (let me know when you do) and I can affix stamps (if you don't have them--please feel free to donate to a ""letter writing stamp fund!"").

AND--this is a great way to support the post office!

First time letter-writers GREATLY welcome! So are children (they are our future)!

We have a new process! Letters will be delivered DIRECTLY to you on Sunday, August 16. Details will be explained in an email update from Kathryn prior to the date.

Our group is self-funded, so please plan to provide your own 20 first-class stamps and 20 #10 business envelopes.

You should expect to complete your 20 letters in less than 2 hours. When you return the letters to us, we'll take care of getting the completed letters mailed out on the appropriate date.

To receive a packet of 20 letters, please register in advance for the date you want. This ensures that we download the correct number of letters (adopted voters) for everyone who wants to participate.

A few things to keep in mind when you attend this virtual phone bank:

Don’t worry if you’ve never done something like this before. We’ll provide a phone script and a list of voters to call.

You’ll need a phone and a laptop computer or tablet to make calls

If we can’t knock on doors, research suggests these letters may be the BEST way to turn out voters in tight races all over the country.

Think about it: if you help get a voter to the polls in one of our targeted Super States, you can deliver a vote for Biden and also possibly a Senate seat, plus impact key State races necessary to roll back gerrymanders.

That’s what Swing Left's Super State Strategy is all about: identifying the voters we need to reach to maximize the impact of your time and money. We look forward to seeing you!
